    <h2>Misconceptions </h2>
    <section class="misc">
      <h3> Intrusive Thoughts </h3>
      <p>Ever hear the phrase "intrusive thoughts" on social media? Chances are, it means a
        <em>totally different thing</em> from what you think it does.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The term "intrusive thoughts" seems to have reached some unwanted fame, with people
        using it to refer to their "impulsive thoughts" instead. "Intrusive" thoughts are <strong>unsafe</strong>
        to act on and <strong>bring the person distress</strong> (which can manifest as <strong>anxiety and
          physical symptoms</strong>), while "impulsive" thoughts are thoughts of actions <strong>without much
          consideration
          to the consequences</strong>.</p>
      <p>For example, an <strong><em>impulsive</em></strong> thought would be "dyeing my hair rainbow",
        while an <strong><em>intrusive</em></strong> thought would be "jumping onto railway tracks".</p>

      <h3>OCD</h3>
      <p><strong>MYTH vs REALITY:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> We're all "a little OCD"</li>
        <li> Having OCD is the same as being a clean freak</li>
        <li> OCD is treatable</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>1. <span>We're all "a little OCD"</span> is <strong>FALSE!</strong> </p>
      <p>OCD is a <strong>severe and debilitating</strong> disorder, so it's definitely not true that OCD affects
        the entire population. If you mean that you are an organised or tidy person, it's best to
        <strong>use different adjectives</strong> to say so!
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>2. <span>Having OCD means being a clean freak</span> is <strong>FALSE!</strong></p>
      <p>Though <strong>some</strong> people with OCD do have hygiene-related compulsions, this
        is a <strong>stereotype</strong> and cannot be generalised to include all people with OCD. People with
        OCD experience "obsessions", which are <strong>uncontrollable, persistent thoughts</strong> that can lead
        to "compulsions".</p>

      <h3>People with Mental Illness</h3>
      <p>There may be misconceptions about people with mental illness in our local spaces, so it's important
        to educate yourself and recognise any <strong>prejudices or stereotypes</strong> you have of them! For example:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li> &nbsp; Being mentally ill is a choice</li>
        <li> &nbsp; People with mental illnesses are usually dangerous and violent </li>
        <li> &nbsp; Mental illnesses are incurable and hopeless</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>In general, just try to be more <strong>accepting and inclusive</strong> towards people with mental illnesses and
        <strong>listen</strong> to what they have to say, especially when it comes to their own problems.
