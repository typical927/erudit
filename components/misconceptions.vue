    <h2>Misconceptions </h2>
    <section class = "misc"> 
      <h3> Intrusive Thoughts </h3>
        <p>Ever hear the phrase "intrusive thoughts" on social media? Chances are, it means a 
          <em>totally different thing</em> from what you think it does.</p>
        <p>The term "intrusive thoughts" seems to have reached some unwanted fame, with people 
          using it to refer to their "impulsive thoughts" instead. What separates the two is that 
          the former encompasses thoughts that are <strong>unsafe</strong> to act on and <strong>bring the person distress</strong>
          (which can manifest as <strong>anxiety and physical symptoms</strong>), while the latter refers to thoughts 
          that drive actions <strong>without much consideration of their consequences</strong>.</p>
        <p>For example, an <strong><em>impulsive</em></strong> thought would be "dyeing my hair rainbow", while an <strong><em>intrusive</em></strong>
          thought would be "jumping onto railway tracks".</p>

        <h3>OCD</h3>
        <p><strong>MYTH vs REALITY:</strong></p>
        <ul> <!--if we have time lets make this a js thing-->
           <li> We're <em>all</em> "a little OCD"</li> <!--false-->
           <li> Having OCD means being a <em>clean freak</em></li> <!--false-->
           <li> OCD is <em>treatable</em></li> <!--true-->
        </ul>
        <p>1. <span>We're all "a little OCD"</span> is <strong>FALSE!</strong> </p>
        <p>OCD is a <strong>severe and debilitating</strong> disorder, so it's definitely not true that OCD affects
            the entire population. If you mean that you are an <strong>organised or tidy</strong> person, it's best to 
            <strong>use different adjectives</strong> to say so!</p>
        <p>2. <span>Having OCD means being a clean freak</span> is <strong>FALSE!</strong></p>
        <p>Though it may be true that <em>some</em> people with OCD have hygiene-related compulsions, this
          is definitely a <strong>stereotype</strong> and <strong>cannot</strong> be generalised to include all people with OCD. People with 
          OCD experience <em>"obsessions"</em>, which are <strong>uncontrollable and persistent thoughts</strong>, which can lead
          to <em>"compulsions"</em>.</p>

        <h3>People with Mental Illness</h3>
        <p>There may be <strong>misconceptions</strong> about people with mental illness in our local spaces, so it's important
          to educate yourself and recognise any <strong>prejudices or stereotypes</strong> you have of them! For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Mental illness is a <em>choice</em></li>
            <li> People with mental illnesses are <em>always</em> dangerous and violent </li>
            <li> Mental illnesses are <em>incurable and hopeless</em></li>
          </ul>  
        <p>In general, just try to be more <strong>accepting and inclusive</strong> towards people with mental illnesses and
        <strong>listen</strong> to what they have to say, especially when it comes to their own problems</p>
