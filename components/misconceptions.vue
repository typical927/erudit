    <h2>Misconceptions </h2>

      <h3> Intrusive Thoughts </h3>
        <p>Ever hear the phrase "intrusive thoughts" on social media? Chances are, it means a 
          totally different thing from what you think it does.</p>
        <p>The term "intrusive thoughts" seems to have reached some unwanted fame, with people 
          using it to refer to their "impulsive thoughts" instead. What separates the two is that 
          the former encompasses thoughts that are unsafe to act on and bring the person distress
          (which can manifest as anxiety and physical symptoms), while the latter refers to thoughts 
          that drive actions without much consideration of their consequences.</p>
        <p>For example, an impulsive thought would be "dyeing my hair rainbow", while an intrusive
          thought would be "jumping onto railway tracks".</p>

        <h3>OCD</h3>
        <ul>MYTH vs REALITY: <!--if we have time lets make this a js thing-->
           <li>We're all "a little OCD"</li> <!--false-->
           <li>Having OCD means being a clean freak</li> <!--false-->
           <li>OCD is treatable</li> <!--true-->
        </ul>
        <p>1. <span>We're all "a little OCD"</span> is FALSE! </p>
        <p>OCD is a severe and debilitating disorder, so it's definitely not true that OCD affects
            the entire population. If you mean that you are an organised or tidy person, it's best to 
            use different adjectives to say so!</p>
        <p>2. <span>Having OCD means being a clean freak</span> is FALSE!</p>
        <p>Though it may be true that some people with OCD have hygiene-related compulsions, this
          is definitely a stereotype and cannot be generalised to include all people with OCD. People with 
          OCD experience "obsessions", which are uncontrollable and persistent thoughts, which can lead
          to "compulsions".</p>

        <h3>People with Mental Illness</h3>
        <p>There may be misconceptions about people with mental illness in our local spaces, so it's important
          to educate yourself and recognise any prejudices or stereotypes you have of them! For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>People have mental illnesses as a result of their own choices</li>
            <li>People with mental illnesses are always dangerous and violent </li>
            <li>Mental illnesses are incurable and hopeless</li>
          </ul>  
        <p>In general, just try to be more accepting and inclusive towards people with mental illnesses and
        listen to what they have to say, especially when it comes to their own problems</p>
