      <h3>Peer pressure</h3>
      <p>Peer pressure is when you do something because you want to feel <strong>accepted and valued</strong> by your friends. Managing peer 
      pressure involves <strong>understanding your own beliefs and values</strong>, building <strong>self-confidence</strong>, and <strong>communicating openly</strong> with peers. 
      Surround yourself with supportive friends, confidently say "no" when needed, and assertively express your boundaries. Plan 
      ahead for pressure situations and seek support from others if necessary. </p>

      <h3>Stress and burnout</h3>
      <p>Stress is natural and can be healthy in moderate amounts, but when stress becomes <strong>too intense</strong> or continues for a 
      <strong>prolonged period of time</strong>, it becomes harmful and impacts our lives negatively. Talking to a loved one or a close friend 
      about how the day went, partaking in your hobbies or even exercising can be a great stress-reliever. Additionally, try to <strong>identify and keep track of your stressors</strong>, 
      and reduce them if possible. It is important to solve the problem at the source, and not just address the symptoms. Another tip would 
      be to <strong>set boundaries</strong> for yourself and try to <strong>prioritise your physical and mental health</strong> more, so as 
      to prevent prolonged burnout and possibly depression or development of other mental illnesses.</p>

      <h3>Self esteem </h3>
      <p> Low self-esteem has the potential to lead to a variety of mental health disorders, including <strong>anxiety disorders and 
      depressive disorders.</strong> You may also find it difficult to pursue your goals and maintain healthy relationships. Having
      low self-esteem can seriously impact your quality of life and increases your risk for experiencing suicidal thoughts. <br>
      Some actions that you can take to help improve your self-esteem include: <br>
      <ul>
      <li> &nbsp; Become more aware of negative thoughts. Learn to identify the <strong>distorted thoughts</strong> that are impacting your self-worth. </li>
      <li> &nbsp; Challenge negative thinking patterns. When you find yourself engaging in negative thinking, try countering those thoughts with more realistic and/or positive ones. </li>
      <li> &nbsp; Use <strong>positive self-talk</strong>. Practice reciting or writing down positive affirmations for yourself. </li>
      <li> &nbsp; Understand that <strong>no one is perfect</strong> and that <strong>you are enough, just as you are</strong>. When you truly believe this, it will help you with self-acceptance and building confidence
      despite your shortcomings.</li>
      </ul>
