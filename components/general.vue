      <h3>Peer pressure</h3>
      <p>Peer pressure is when you do something because you want to feel accepted and valued by your friends. Managing peer 
      pressure involves understanding your own beliefs and values, building self-confidence, and communicating openly with peers. 
      Surround yourself with supportive friends, confidently say "no" when needed, and assertively express your boundaries. Plan 
      ahead for pressure situations and seek support from others if necessary. </p>

      <h3>Stress and burnout</h3>
      <p>Stress is natural and can be healthy in moderate amounts, but when stress becomes too intense or continues for a 
      prolonged period of time, it becomes harmful and impacts our lives negatively. Talking to a loved one or a close friend 
      about how the day went, partaking in your hobbies or even exercising can be a great stress-reliever. Additionally, try to identify and keep track of your stressors, 
      and reduce them if possible. It is important to solve the problem at the source, and not just address the symptoms. Another tip would be to set boundaries for yourself and try to prioritise your physical and mental health
      more, so as to prevent prolonged burnout and possibly depression or development of other mental illnesses.</p>

      <h3>Self esteem </h3>
      <p>
      Low self-esteem has the potential to lead to a variety of mental health disorders, including <strong>anxiety disorders and 
      depressive disorders.</strong> You may also find it difficult to pursue your goals and maintain healthy relationships. Having 
      low self-esteem can seriously impact your quality of life and increases your risk for experiencing suicidal thoughts. <br>
      Some actions that you can take to help improve your self-esteem include: <br>
      <ul>
      <li> Become more aware of negative thoughts. Learn to identify the distorted thoughts that are impacting your self-worth. </li>
      <li> Challenge negative thinking patterns. When you find yourself engaging in negative thinking, try countering those thoughts with more realistic and/or positive ones. </li>
      <li> Use positive self-talk. Practice reciting or writing down positive affirmations for yourself. </li>
      <li> Understand that no one is perfect and that you are enough, just as you are. When you truly believe this, it will help you with self-acceptance and building confidence
      despite your shortcomings.</li>
      </ul>
