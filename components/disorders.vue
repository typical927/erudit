      <h3>Depression </h3>
      <p> Depression, or depressive disorder, is characterized by <strong>persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness</strong>, and a <strong>lack of interest or pleasure in 
        activities</strong>. It can also lead to physical symptoms like <strong>changes in appetite and sleep patterns</strong>. This is one of the more common disorders, as can
        be seen through a study, which showed that 14.1% of surveyed adults had symptoms consistent with depression. Despite this high statistic, depression is still a severe and
        debilitating disorder which has the ability to significantly alter people's lives.

        adequate reason for suspicion. This personality disorder belongs in the Cluster A category, which means that you may show behaviours that seem odd or unusual to others.

        harm or threaten them.</strong> This disorder is relatively rare and only affects less than 5% of the population.</p>

      <h3>Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD)</h3> 
      <p> People with ASPD show a lack of respect toward others and don't follow socially accepted norms or rules. People with 
        ASPD may break the law or cause physical or emotional harm to others around them. They may refuse to take responsibility
         for their behaviors and/or display disregard for the negative consequences of their actions. Genetics and childhood experiences 
         both play big roles in the development of ASPD. A person with ASPD is likely to have grown up in difficult family circumstances, which would
         cause the development of ASPD following that.

      resulting in <strong>low self-esteem, mood swings, impulsive behaviors and subsequent relationship difficulties.</strong>. People with BPD often engage in what would be 
      perceived as "risky behaviour", because of their wn emotional instability. While BPD has historically mostly been diagnosed in adults, it is 
      also possible for BPD to begin developing in children or adolescents before they turn 18, depending on their circumstances.

      <h3>Avoidant personality disorder</h3> 
      <p>People with this condition have <strong>chronic feelings of inadequacy</strong> and are <strong>highly sensitive 
      to being negatively judged by others</strong>. Though they would like to interact with others, they tend to 
      avoid social interaction due to the <strong>intense fear of being rejected.</strong> Though commonly confused with agoraphobia, the two are actually
      distinct in nature. This is also a more uncommon disorder, with only about 3% of the population being affected by avoidant personality disorder.

      <h3>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</h3> 
      <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a disorder where a person has uncontrollable, reoccuring thoughts that are often disturbing in nature, which then lead
      to repetitive behaviours, known as compulsions. Sometimes, OCD can be marked by a consistent and extreme need for <strong>orderliness, perfectionism
       and control</strong> (with no room for flexibility) that ultimately slows or interferes with completing a 
       task. It can also interfere with interpersonal relationships and other areas of one's life.
