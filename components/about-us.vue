    <h2>About Us </h2>
    <p>This website and chatbot was made with the intention of:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Raising awareness on mental health,</li>
    <li> Educating youths and the public on lesser-known or more stigmatised conditions,</li>
    <li> Providing a safe space for those with mental health issues, and</li>
    <li> Presenting a repository of information on mental health and relevant resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>With this website, we hope that Singaporean youths like ourselves and our peers will be better equipped with the knowledge and skills to support themselves and others
    when it comes to their mental health, especially in these turbulent times. Do note that this site is not meant as a substitute for professional help or advice; it is merely a 
    safe space for users to access information regarding mental health.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Our templates are sourced from TailwindUI, and designed in Figma. Relevant information was sourced from resources like Healthhub SG, and the DSM-V. <br>
    This program was developed by 3 high school students.</p>
